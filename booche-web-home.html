        <h1>His favorite activities</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Tug of War</li>
            <li>Chasing a tennis ball across the yard</li>
            <li>Going for walks</li>
            <li>Trying to sneak food from the table</li>
            <li>Running away whenever I pull out his hairbrush</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He also likes to come sleep in my room at night. He will come with me downstairs in the evening and jump into my bed hogging it.</p>
        <p>He is my first dog and I love him very much!</p>
